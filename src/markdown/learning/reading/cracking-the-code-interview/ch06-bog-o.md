- Big O basic
  - Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.
  - asymptotic runtime or big O times
  - In academia
    - big O describes an upper bound on the time.
    - big omega is for lower bound
    - big theta means both O and omega
    - big theta, tight bound on runtime
