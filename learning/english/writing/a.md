- This past weekend at Startup Calgary, I pitched my idea of Service Swap that I had brewing for a bit, and I won!

- The business is not noly unique, but revolutionary to improve the quality of life all around through democratizing people's time.

- Please let me know if you're keen on working on this personal initiative.
