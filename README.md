# Learning

## Background

This project is for my personal learning. When I start this project, I just random throw notes into different folders and notes. After a while, I noticed that this learnning folder should be the place that I store my notes and have a overview of my learning path.

For example, I followed several Udemy courses, but I couldn't remember the most of their details after a while. This is the nature of brain works. But if I have an outline on my hand, I could easily remember the scene that I was learning. It will help me recalling the knowledge.

Also, for an overview of my previous learning, these notes are useful. I will add learning outlets, personal notes, summary and so on.

I also have several languate/framework/project specific projects. Those projects are more domain specific and detailed.
