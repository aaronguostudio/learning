# Learning

> This project contains all of the notes during my learning. Notes are very important. For this learning notes project, I will use it as the main learning materials, the notes and the examples should be very clear, good organized and nice indexed. And this learning project contains all of the summary for each topics, the contents are a part of my brain's neuron network. For the deep knowledge or real coding examples or solutions, I will create new project for that topic. For examle: learn-java, learn-node... I hope this learning strategy could help me learning faster and remember knowledage easier.
