This project is based on my personal learning project. I am using gatsby ![markdown pages startar](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-markdown-pages) to create this project.

## Learning Notes

This project contains the notes during my daily learning. Notes are very helpful for my learning. For this learning notes project, I use it as my main review materials.

The notes and the examples should be very clear, good organized and nice indexed. And this learning project contains all of the summary for each topics, the contents are a part of my brain's neuron network. For the deep knowledge or real coding examples or solutions, I will create new project for that topic. For examle: learn-java, learn-node... I hope this learning strategy could help me learning faster and remember knowledage easier.

This is a continus in-progress project, I am migrating all of the notes into markdown-pages and publish them as static pages.
