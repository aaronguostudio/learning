# Learning

> This project contains all of the notes during my learning. Notes are very important. Usually I take notes and add flash cards in Anki and review the topics based on the Anki review cycles. This process works fine but sometimes I can't make very good notes and also the Anki sometimes is outdated. For this learning notes, I will use it as the main learning materials, the notes and the examples should be very clear, good organized and nice index. And this learning project contains all of the summary for each topics, the contents are a part of my brain's neuron network. For the deep knowledge or real coding examles or solutions, I will create new project for that topic. For examle: learn-java, learn-node... I hope this learning strategy could help me learning faster and remember knowledage easier.

## Background

This project is for my personal learning. When I start this project, I just random throw notes into different folders and notes. After a while, I noticed that this learnning folder should be the place that I store my notes and have a overview of my learning path.

For example, I followed several Udemy courses, but I couldn't remember the most of their details after a while. This is the nature of brain works. But if I have an outline on my hand, I could easily remember the scene that I was learning. It will help me recalling the knowledge.

Also, for an overview of my previous learning, these notes are useful. I will add learning outlets, personal notes, summary and so on.

I also have several languate/framework/project specific projects. Those projects are more domain specific and detailed.
